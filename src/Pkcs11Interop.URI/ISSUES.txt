Pkcs11Interop.URI implements full PKCS#11 URI (draft 19) specification 
with the following known limitations:

 - As recommended by PKCS#11 URI specification Pkcs11UriBuilder class 
   percent-encodes the whole value of the "id" attribute which is supposed 
   to be handled as arbitrary binary data. Therefore it is not possible to 
   construct URIs with arbitrary string value of the "id" attribute.
 - Validation of each individual attribute value is performed by the setter 
   of corresponding Pkcs11UriBuilder class property with the exception to 
   UnknownPathAttributes and UnknownQueryAttributes properties whose values 
   are validated when ToString() or ToPkcs11Uri() method is called.
